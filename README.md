# Simulation Project - FLIP Demonstration

As part of the simulations module for my MSc Computer Animation and visual effects, I adapted the [10 minute physics FLIP simulation](https://github.com/matthias-research/pages/blob/master/tenMinutePhysics/18-flip.html) into C++, with an export to visualise in Houdini.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I95Q97xDDaI) dislpays the simulation at work, with parameters being adjusted.
